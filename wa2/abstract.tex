Ray tracing is a rendering technique, which allows to generate more photorealistic images, when compared with rasterization techniques. Nevertheless, this comes with the cost of a much greater computational expense. However, ray tracing allows rendering objects, which are represented by other means than explicit vertex data \cite{bungartz:2013:einfuhrung}. This paper discuses the rendering of objects, which are represented implicitly with mathematical functions, in particular in form of \glspl{sdf} \cite{osher:2006:level}. Lastly, there will be a brief section of how \glspl{sdf} can be manipulated.
