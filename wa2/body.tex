Ray tracing is a rendering technique, which allows to generate more photorealistic images, when compared with rasterization techniques. Nevertheless, this comes with the cost of a much greater computational expense. However, ray tracing allows the rendering objects, which are represented by other means than explicit vertex data \cite{bungartz:2013:einfuhrung}. This paper discuses the rendering of objects, which are represented implicitly with mathematical functions \cite{osher:2006:level}.
